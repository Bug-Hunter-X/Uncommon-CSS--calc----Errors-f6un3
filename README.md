# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS. These errors are often subtle and can be difficult to debug.  The `bug.css` file contains examples of these errors, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected code.

**Issues:**
* Using `calc()` with incompatible units (e.g., percentages and percentages).
* Missing or extra spaces in the `calc()` expression.
* Incorrect use of operators.

**Solutions:**
* Ensure units are compatible (e.g., combine percentages and pixels).
* Carefully check the spacing in your `calc()` expressions.
* Verify that all operators are correct.

This repository is intended to help developers avoid these common pitfalls and write more robust CSS code.
