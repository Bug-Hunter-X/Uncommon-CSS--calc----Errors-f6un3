The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS. However, there are some uncommon errors that can occur while using `calc()`. One such error is when using `calc()` with percentages and other units. For example, `width: calc(50% + 10px);` is a valid calculation, but `width: calc(50% + 10%);` is invalid because percentages cannot be added directly to percentages. Another uncommon error is when there are missing or extra spaces in the `calc()` expression. For instance, `width: calc(50% + 10px);` is correct, but `width: calc( 50% + 10px);` or `width: calc(50% +10px);` might lead to unexpected results. Also, make sure to use the correct operators such as +, -, *, and / for the respective calculations. Using an incorrect operator can lead to unexpected results. Finally, ensure the units are consistent within the calculation.
